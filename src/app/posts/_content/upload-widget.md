The latest in my efforts to just play around with HTML/CSS a little more in my spare time. For this I grabbed the PSD called [Upload Widget](http://365psd.com/day/4-25/) from 365 PSD and converted it to HTML/CSS/JS.

This has only been tested for the latest Chrome & Firefox builds and very briefly checked in IE8+. There is no functionality in place.
