I saw this [Transparent Dropdown](https://www.freeimages.com/psd/transparent-dropdown-5414416?ref=365psd) PSD I liked over at 365 PSD and thought it would be a bit of fun to convert into working HTML & CSS, so I did.

It purely for fun so it has only been tested for the latest Chrome & Firefox builds and very briefly checked in IE8+. Basic Javascript and CSS transitions are used to toggle the active class to show and hide the dropdown.
