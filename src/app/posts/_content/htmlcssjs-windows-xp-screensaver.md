It turned out I didnâ€™t have a basketball game tonight so I got a little bored; Then this happened, I recreated the Windows XP Screensaver using HTML, CSS & Javascript.

This has only been tested for the latest Chrome & Firefox builds.

Be sure to jump into full screen mode for the maximum effect.
