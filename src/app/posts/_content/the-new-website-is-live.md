## It is finally done, my new website is live.

I know that it is not 100% complete in all areas in fact I am still working on polishing all the little things over time, but I have decided it was taking too long and I just needed to get it done. So here we are.

## A little background on the design

### My previous web site design

My old portfolio was simple and effective, big bold typography laid over a modern style design and in all honesty, I loved it.

The major weakness with this design was there was no real information about what I do, just examples of my work. The old gal had gotten me plenty of work but it was time for an upgrade and I was excited about having 100% creative control once again.

## The new and improved design

My new website’s main purpose was to provide more information about who I am and what I do. I wanted to take the elements which made the old design work; strong use of type, strong colours and very simple page structure and apply that overall feel to my new design. Although I did want a completely different style than my previous site.

I started this design in late March and had it, visually, at a stage where I was happy in early April. I kept going back and forth refining more and more elements, simplifying everything and trying to fit as much information in to as little as space as possible and as usual, I worked on it so much I started to dislike it. It was here when I stopped and said, “just shut up and build this damn thing.” So that is exactly what I did.

The bulk of the site was built and running in mid April but was delayed launch for reasons such as a heavy workload, a quick holiday and a general laziness when it comes to writing web content. I could have outsourced it, which probably would’ve resulted in nicer written content, but I wanted to do it myself.

I finished enough of the content earlier today to make it live and decided it was time to get it up and running and I can iron out the little errors as I go.

## More marketing improvements

### Business Cards

So my website is ~~done~~ live and what else is there? First off the bat was business cards. My previous business cards were designed to complement my portfolio of the time, as such, I was concerned that if I didn’t update there would be a disconnect when someone visits the new website.

I kind of cheated with this because I had actually designed and printed my business cards at least a few weeks before my site was completed. Bad move, I know, luckily I didn’t feel the need to sway from this design at all.

### Social Marketing

I finally set up a Twitter account, I can’t believe I avoided it as long as I did and I have to say that it is a great service. I love following some of my favourite designers/developers and seeing what they are working on.

I will probably be creating a Facebook page sometime soon as another way of providing people with a chance to get in touch.

Linked in is another big thing I need to work on. It is not so much of a big deal in Australia, but is another fantastic tool for networking online.

### The end of this chapter

So that sums up this first post of my new and shiny blog (which I will hopefully use more often). I would love to have some feedback on my design, so please, leave a comment and let me know what works and what doesn’t.
