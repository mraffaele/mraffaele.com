Just a quick update to mention that I have released the latest [Steam Regional Prices Chrome Extension](/posts/steam-regional-prices-chrome-extension) update as well as some website updates to go with it.

If you are running the Chrome Extension you should be upgraded to v1.0.2 automatically.

## Updates include
### Chrome Extension (v1.0.2)
- Modified the context menu to only show the Steam ARPC option when either currently on a Steam URL, or on a hyperlinked Steam URL.
- Corrected issue with some games not providing any results

### Website
- Minor CSS updates
- Added ability to browse more (and more) popular searches on homepage

You can view the full change log [here](https://www.steamregionalprices.com/updates.php).

I have a major upgrade hopefully coming out in the next couple of weeks which should add more functionality and some promising speed improvements. Stay tuned.

### Update:
I just applied a quick server side update today too (September 21) that doesnâ€™t need a client update. View the full changes [here](https://www.steamregionalprices.com/updates.php).
