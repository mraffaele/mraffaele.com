summary: "Converted a PSD into HTML/CSS; a minimal white UI kit"
---

I spent a little more time playing around with HTML & CSS – again I’ve just taken the source from 365 PSD, this time a [White UI Kit](http://365psd.com/day/4-32/). 

This example uses techniques I would not use in production as its far from cross-browser friendly nor is it polished enough to use. There is some redundant CSS here too but that is not important for today. 

Has only been tested in the latest version of Chrome and Firefox.
